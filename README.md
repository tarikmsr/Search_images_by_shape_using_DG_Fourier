# search_image_by_shape_using_DG_Fourier

The main objective of this mini-project is to index and search for images based on
on the shape characteristics that we will extract from the images thanks to the use of
Fourrier descriptors. Once the indexing is complete.

I created the project using the Flask Framework, in this interface, the user will give an image, we
will extract the characteristics of this image always using the Descriptors
of fourrier then I calculate the similarity between the image given by the user and the images
that I have already indexed in the image database. The result returned by the program is the
images similar to the entrance image.

## Conclusion

Although they have been around for almost a decade, image search engines are slowly coming to the fore.
little at maturity. They are able to compare images with each other. Their results, which should to be further improved, are already very satisfactory.
I have developed a web application, with Flask as a server, which allows to implement the basic functionalities of an image indexing and search system by content.
